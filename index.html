          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Income</h3>
          <p>The charts above display positive correlations between risk factors obesity and smoking in relation to poverty and household income. 
              The visible trend indicates that less affluent and poorer states have higher obesity rates and greater tendencies of smoking. 
              Wealthier states not only had higher rates of healthcare coverage, but lower obesity and smoking rates.
              The visualizations also indicate that the trends are not absolute because there are some clear outliers. 
              For example, there are states such as North Dakota and Iowa with relatively low poverty and high obesity rates.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age</h3>
          <p>The correlations between health risks and age are more convoluted. The median ages in most US states are between 
              36-40 years old. This clustered the visualizations making them more difficult to identify. However, a keen
              eye would be able to see that there are indeed some correlations, such as: higher median age and higher healthcare
              coverage, lower median age and lower smoking rates, and finally, lower median age and lower obesity rates.</p>
